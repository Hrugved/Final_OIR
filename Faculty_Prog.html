                          <p>SFU and MITACS have partnered to launch a student exchange program to send and receive students with the Indian Institute of Technology. The goal of this partnership is to raise the profile of SFU in India in general, attract the top students from India to SFU for undergraduate and graduate studies, foster collaborations with IIT faculty leading to more collaborative research and joint grants etc. and to provide SFU students an opportunity to experience research in India at the IITs thereby broadening their horizons on the systems in place in another part of the world.

                            <p>FAQ's</p>
                            <p>1) I am an IIT student, how do I proceed? 

                              Ans: Find a faculty member at SFU in your area of interest and contact them with your CV and expression of interest. You will also need an 'anchor' for the internship on the IIT-end so please find a faculty member at IIT willing to supervise you from that side. It would be useful if you can look at the MITACS forms above, fill them out and send them along with your emails to both the faculty contacts (at SFU and IIT). 
                              
                              http://www.sfu.ca/engineering.html 
                              
                              http://www.sfu.ca/computing.html 
                              
                              http://www.sfu.ca/mechatronics.html
                              
                               </p>
                               <p>2) What level of students are eligible? 

                                Ans: The exchange is open to all IIT students, undergraduate or graduate. Undergraduate students in the third year or beyond will get preference but undergraduate students in the second year are also encouraged to apply. All graduate students, Master's or PhD are eligible and encouraged to seek a host lab at SFU for their research.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>3) Is there a deadline? 

                                  Ans: This exchange is open all year around, till the seats allocated are filled up. For undergraduate students looking to visit Vancouver in summer period to coincide with your summer holidays, it would be important to start early. Normally, MITACS will take 4 weeks to approve completed paperwork filed with them. The visa process in India will take some time.Factor these times to get an idea of when you have to start to seek SFU faculty interest to apply.</p>
                                  <p>4) Who do I contact? 

                                    Ans: See point (1) above. Find your host lab from these links and contact your host lab Professor directly with your CV.

                                    Find an anchor at the IIT side, a Professor their who can supervise your internship from that end.</p>
                                    <p>5) The MITACS link shows the deadline has passed. 

                                      Ans: This program is a parallel new program to the MITACS GRA program and it is specific to IIT and SFU student exchange. It uses the same template forms as the regular MITACS GRA but it is open all year around. Do not worry about deadline being passed.</p>
                       <p>6) Is this exchange open to any lab at SFU? 

                        Ans: Yes, you can find any supervisor at SFU whose research you are interested in working on. Faculty of Applied Science interns will however get an additional stipend of $2000 CAD.
                        
                         </p> 
                         <p>7) Where do I send completed applications? 

                          Ans: Applicants should submit completed application packages to SFUâ€™s Mitacs representative Allison Brennan at mitacsbd@sfu.ca with a cc to Mirza Faisal Beg ( mfbeg@sfu.ca) if you are applying to a FAS faculty member.
